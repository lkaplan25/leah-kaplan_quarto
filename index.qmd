### Hi, I'm Leah.

*(pronounced lay-uh..yes, like the Star Wars character)*

I want to understand how we can better leverage emerging transportation technologies for the benefit of, rather than detriment to, society.

I am an Associate in [Exponent's Vehicle Engieering Practice](https://www.exponent.com/expertise/vehicle-engineering), specializing in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.

I hold a doctorate in Systems Engineering from the George Washington University, where I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and a fellow with GWU's [Co-Design of Trustworthy AI Systems NSF Research Traineeship Program](https://dtais.seas.gwu.edu/). My dissertation research examined several potential impacts of autonomous vehicles and used them as a case study of the potential societal effects of AI-enabled automation in the physical world.
